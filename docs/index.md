# What is the Original Fire Extension?

Original Fire generates wildfires that are dependent upon fire region (or 'landtype') specific inputs. Original Fire follows the principles of older LANDIS versions (v3.6 and earlier) whereby fire patches are put on the landscape following a log-normal size distribution and fire severity is a function of time-since-last-fire.
